-------------------

LBRYMeta Dumper is a tool that uses LBRY's Chainquery API to fetch a channel meta in JSON format
Bineries are available at [Releases](https://github.com/Eniamza/lbrymeta/releases)

### How does this works?

-------------------

It uses LBRY's Chainquery API. You can find detailed explaination [HERE](https://lbry.com/news/what-is-chainquery). 
What this application does is it makes a GET request to the API and indents it properly then saves them to a JSON file for further usage.

### In Granny Terms :

-------------------
Suppose Meta Information such as Name, description, claimid is Cake :yum: . Which is stored on a shelf. Now you want to take all the cake home and eat it later. Picking up one by one would be time consuming. So you [The app] picks up the whole cakeshelf [The Meta table] and store it in a truck [The JSON file].
